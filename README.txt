FNURGLETOE

Fnurgletoe is an iPhone remake of Egg Chess, but an original implementation.

The objective of this board game is simple: be the first player to put three 
identical pieces in a row. There's only one problem: your opponent can change 
your pieces and use them against you!

It's like 3-in-a-row, it's like tic-tac-toe... but much harder! Play against
the iPhone or another person, or watch the iPhone play itself.
